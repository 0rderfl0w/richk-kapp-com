# richkapp.com — Changelog

> Newest at top. Never delete entries. Agents prepend here after significant work.

## 2025-07-15
- Full rewrite of /ai page (Alex). Old focus: "stop renting SaaS / join B2OC." New focus: done-for-you AI quote agents for trade contractors.
- Decision: B2OC demoted to small card at bottom of page. Main product is custom agent setup ($597 + $97/mo).
- 5 verticals called out explicitly: Painters, Roofers, Restoration, Landscapers, HVAC with per-trade pain and fix.
- B2OC mention preserved in Why Me section as credibility signal and as small community card at bottom.
- Old page backed up at src/pages/ai.astro.bak.

> For code-level changes, see `git log --oneline -20`.
