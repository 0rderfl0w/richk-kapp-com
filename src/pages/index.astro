            <p>
              I'm Richard Kappel. At 26, I exited my first company in Chicago. Since then, I've built across industries and continents; launching a hostel, founding a nonprofit that grew into a social enterprise spanning 11 countries with a 40+ person team, and supporting startups from around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through all of it, one thing has been constant: I thrive on solving hard problems and bringing order to chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Twenty years in the game taught me one thing: clarity isn't found in books or frameworks. It's built through decisions, mistakes, and the willingness to keep moving when the path isn't clear.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, I put that experience to work for individuals and teams who want to cut through noise, see what they can't see alone, and move forward with clarity and confidence.
